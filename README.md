# PhishVN — Vietnamese URL Phishing Dataset & Baselines

Code and documentation for **PhishVN**, an open, time-stamped Vietnamese URL phishing dataset
(53,116 URLs: an 18,997-record verified core of 2,587 phishing / 16,410 legitimate, plus a
34,119-record community/feed bronze expansion) with a CompPhish-aligned 21-feature lexical
schema, impersonation-scenario labels, gold/silver/bronze confidence tiers, and a group-aware
temporal split.

## What's here
- `scripts/` — URL data collection, normalisation, CompPhish features, baselines, audit, release tools.
- `docs/` — datasheet, column schema, data-source notes.
- `docs/verify/` — the completed human label audit: time-stamped pre-specified codebook (with its amendment
  log), both annotators' independent sheets, the machine pass, and the arbitration record.
- `tests/`, `configs/`, `Makefile`, `dvc.yaml` — reproducibility.

## Label audit (completed 2026-08-15)
Two annotators independently re-checked a blinded, stratified 200-row sample against a four-way
codebook (credential *phishing* / other *scam* / *legitimate* / *unsure*) that forbids consulting
any blocklist and treats plausibility as non-evidence. Independent-round agreement: 0.710
(Cohen's κ 0.609) four-way; 0.820 (κ 0.725) collapsed to the abuse-vs-legitimate distinction the
released binary label makes. After documented arbitration of the 58 disagreements, 149/200 rows
resolve; against the source labels the positive arm shows **12.1% label noise** (95% CI
7.1–20.0%, concentrated in the explicitly-tagged bronze stratum) and the benign arm 4.0%.
Every number is recomputable from `docs/verify/` via `make_verification_sample.py score`; the
full record is in `docs/datasheet.md`.

## Quickstart
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# download the dataset from the Mendeley DOI into data/processed/ , then:
make url          # train the URL baseline (LogReg/RF, multi-seed + bootstrap CI)
make test         # unit tests
```

## Key scripts
- `normalize_merge.py` — merge raw sources -> common schema, scheme-independent URL features,
  scenario inference, group-aware temporal split.
- `compphish_features.py` / `align_compphish.py` — CompPhish 21-feature schema (cross-dataset).
- `train_url_baseline.py` — URL baseline; `--seeds` (mean±std) and `--bootstrap` (95% CI).
- `fetch_tranco.py` — hard benign negatives from the Tranco top-list.
- `make_verification_sample.py` — two-annotator label audit + Cohen's kappa.
- `machine_pass_composition.py` — rule-based pass over the archived page behind each sampled
  domain. It reports a negative result and `docs/verify/MACHINE_PASS.csv` is that result: the
  sample's known-legitimate stratum acts as a control, the credential rule fires on it as often as
  on listed domains (13.9% vs 12.5%, Fisher p = 1.00), and only 17% of listed rows resolve at all.
  Read it as evidence that this corpus cannot be adjudicated from web archives — not as a
  composition estimate, and never as a substitute for the human audit.
- `make_release.py` — build the citable open / gated release bundles.
